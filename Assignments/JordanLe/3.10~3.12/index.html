      <p>Hello World!</p>
      <p>This drawing machine is like a drawing simulator. You get to draw lines and shapes as you click and drag on the green canvas.
        You can even make them colorful by turning on rainbow mode or even gradient mode, via shortcut keys.
        <br>If you made a mistake in your drawing, you can press the spacebar to clear the drawing and start a new one.
        The list of shortcut keys to do different types of draw modes are available in the controls tab.  To save a drawing, press the s key.
        <br>By saving your drawing, you get to save it on your hard drive for memory's sake OR share it with your friends.</p>
        <p>Draw whatever you like, whatever comes to your imagination, and make use of it,
          so you can be happy with it and live your drawing passions to the fullest.</p>
