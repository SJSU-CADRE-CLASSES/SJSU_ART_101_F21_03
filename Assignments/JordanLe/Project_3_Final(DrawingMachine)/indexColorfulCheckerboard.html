      <p>Hello World!</p>
      <p>This drawing machine is like a drawing simulator. You get to draw lines and shapes as you click and drag on the green canvas.
        You can even make them colorful by turning on rainbow mode or even gradient mode, via shortcut keys.
        <br>If you made a mistake in your drawing, you can press the spacebar to clear the drawing and start a new one.
        The list of shortcut keys to do different types of draw modes are available in the controls tab.  To save a drawing, press the 's' key.
        <br>By saving your drawing, you get to save it on your hard drive for memory's sake OR share it with your friends.
        The purpose for this drawing machine is to create new ways to draw by discovering a lot of draw mode possibilities.</p>
        <p>In grid mode, you get to see your mouse cursor's x and y coordinates by inspecting this webpage and click on console.
          Using perlin brush in grid mode may have a chance of thickening the boarders or even turning the screen black for every spacebar pressed.
          Using faded brush in grid mode may also fade the grid, leaving you with a green background (should be able to reset grid every couple of minutes).
          Checkerboard grid mode allows you to determine every other rectangle in order to make measurements a little easier.
          The Colorful Checkerboard puts random colors for each rectangle every time the page refreshes or the drawing gets cleared.
          Draw whatever you like, whatever comes to your imagination, and make use of it,
          so you can be happy with it and live your drawing passions to the fullest.</p>

    <div class="infosDiv">
      <p>[l] : default draw line mode (is toggled on by default)</p>
      <p>[-] : draw dotted line mode (draw dashed lines on mouse click)</p>
      <p>[e] : erase drawing (press the spacebar to erase the whole drawing)</p>
      <p>[s] : save drawing (saves an image of your drawing to your computer)</p>
      <p>[0] : draw circle mode (draw circles on mouse click)</p>
      <p>[4] : draw square mode (draw squares on mouse click)</p>
      <p>[a] : free draw mode (automatically draws with the selected draw mode as you move your mouse cursor)</p>
      <p>[f] : faded draw mode (draws lines/shapes with a fading trail; decreases fade value around every half second and resets fade value at around 256 half-seconds)</p>
      <p>[g] : gradient mode (chooses a random gradient to color when toggled on; only applies to lines for now)</p>
      <p>[r] : rainbow mode (draw colorful(random colored) lines/shapes on mouse click)</p>
      <p>[d] : array line mode (draw "invisible" lines and then press the 'd' key to display the drawn lines; only works when all drawing modes are toggled off)</p>
      <p>[shift] + [d] : disconnect array lines (this allows you to draw another array line that's separate from the previous one)</p>
      <p>[c] : curved array line mode (same as array line mode but provide smoother lines)</p>
      <p>[i] : inverted mode (draw line/shape that goes at the opposite direction of your cursor)</p>
      <p>[x] : symmetric x-axis mode (draw line/shape that's symmetric to your cursor based on the x-axis)</p>
      <p>[y] : symmetric y-axis mode (draw line/shape that's symmetric to your cursor based on the y-axis)</p>
      <p>[p] : perlin brush mode (draw lines/shapes with a dynamic brush size; 50% chance with outline)</p>
